# datsun-240z-console
This is a 3D printable top console for a Datsun 240z. 

1. Printer used: Bambu P1S
2. Filament recommended: eSUN PLA+

Printing:
1. Download 'print-me-datsun-240z-console.3mf'.
2. Open the file with Bambu Studio or Orca Slicer. The models are already pre-sliced.
3. Select the plate you want to print.
4. Hit print.
5. Repeat for all plates until all components are ready.

Assembly
1. Start by assembling the center part of the console. Use the connecting arrows to click the pieces together.
2. The tolerances are pretty tight, I recommend using a small hammer/mallet with a rubber top to gently hammer the pieces flush.

Installation
1. Remove existing center console.
2. The new console should easily slide onto the transmission tunnel.
3. Slide on the side bolsters, the pre made rails should make it easy to click/slide them on.

Known bugs:
1. You need to glue a hingle to the armrest cover and apply it to the inner rear wall of the arm-rest if you want the armrest to go up and down
